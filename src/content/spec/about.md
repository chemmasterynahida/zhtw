## Welcome to my blog!

Nice to meet you! I'm Chemistry Mastery Nahida.  
Right now, I'm majoring in Chemistry, with a focus on *Computational Chemistry*. It's like... using computers to explore the tiniest secret of chemistry!  
I started this website after finishing my undergraduate degree, so I could share what I've learned... and hopefully, learn even more along the way.  
This blog mostly explore *Physical Chemistry* and *Computational Chemistry*, but I'm really curious about everything in chemistry... so who knows what we'll discover together?  
Each post will be written first in *English*, then translated into *Chinese*, *Japanese*, and *Korean*. I'd like to add some translations into *French* in the future.  
I'd love to create videos in the future too, to help explain things visually. I'm still figuring it all out, but... that's part of the fun, isn't it?

> Nahida is a character in the open-world game *Genshin Impact*, known as the Dendro Archon and bearing the Archon name Buer. Revered as the God of Wisdom, she once oversaw the flow of all knowledge in the nation of Sumeru through the Akasha Terminal—a vast network that allowed her citizens access to boundless information.  
> Yet over time, Nahida came to understand a deeper truth: having answers is not the same as understanding them. Many people, she realized, cling to ignorance not out of lack of knowledge, but out of fear; fear of change, of truth, and of asking the hard questions.  
> In her wisdom, she chose to deactivate the Akasha Terminal, not to withhold knowledge, but to encourage genuine inquiry and prevent its misuse by those in power. As she watches over her people, Nahida seeks to inspire the courage to question, reflect, and grow.  

*&nbsp;"I think I'm good at asking the right questions and giving good answers, but I've come to realize that a lot of people just convince themselves they don't understand. The answers to their problems don't help them. It seems to me that as people grow older, they lose the courage to question things and accept the truth..."*  

I really hope you—the "Sages of Buer"—could deeply explore Chemistry with me!  
*&nbsp;"I'll leave this to you... The 'First Sages of Buer'"*

<!--Nice to meet you! I'm Chemistry Mastery Nahida. I'm currently majoring in Chemistry, with a focus on *Computational Chemistry*. I started this website after graduating with my undergraduate degree to share and explore topics related to my field. This blog mainly covers subjects in *Physical Chemistry* and *Computational Chemistry*, but I also plan to touch on various other areas within chemistry. Each post will be written first in *English*, followed by translations in *Chinese*, *Japanese*, and *Korean*. In the future, I hope to expand into other related topics and create videos to complement the articles. I'm still exploring what to include, so stay tuned for updates!>
